# door_lock
A Project that me and Borut umer are working on for MLH

Here are some hints on how to use our application. 
The application uses your home WI-FI connection to determine your location 
and remind you to lock your door when you leave the house. When you stop using 
your WI-FI connection the phone will remind you to lock your front door. 
It also keeps track of every time that you locked or did not lock your door.
