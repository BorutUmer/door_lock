Here are some hints on how to use our application. The application uses your home WI-FI connection to determine your location and remind you to lock your door when you leave the house.
When you stop using your WI-FI connection the phone will remind you to lock your front door. It also keeps track of every time that you locked or did not lock your door.</string>
